## Note

This is a blatant copy of [Destiny 2 Historical Heatmap](https://chrisfried.github.io/secret-scrublandeux/) by [@chrisfried](https://twitter.com/chrisfried), but with dark mode and no Bungie authentication.  
This was built for personal use. If you need a more stable experience, please use the original project.
